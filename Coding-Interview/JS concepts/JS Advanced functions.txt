Array

const arr1 = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'x'];
const arr2 = ['m', 'n', 'x', 'y', 'r'];

1. const set1 = new Set();
	This is used to store different unique elements to the set1 and is used to find duplicates
	set1.add(arr1[i]) -> is used to add non duplicate element
	set1.has(arr2[i])	-> is used to check if the element already exist or not
	
2. Adding array to object
	let tally={}; To add array to object, loop through each element in array to add like below - 
	map[arr1[i]]=true; -> this will take the property as array value and the value is defaulted to true
	
3. arr1.some() -> this is used to check if arr1 matches the value passed in ()
	Like arr1.some(item => arr2.includes(item)) - here arr1 each item is being checked in arr2 and return true is done if match found
	
4. str.split('') - this functions splits the string in the form of array

5. str.split('').reverse() - this function reverses the split string array

6. str.split('').reverse().join(''); - this function joins the reversed split str array

7. Javascript - let, const, var
	let does not allow you to declare a variable twice, although var does allow
	"use strict" is used to specify at the top of the code so that a person mistakenly do not declare a variable twice
	var if declared globally and if value changes inside a function locally then the value remains what got changed locally in global scope as well but let if declared outside function and value changed inside, then it does not impact the value globally.
	if var is defined inside function, you can access it globally, but if let is defined locally in function then you cannot access it outside scope
	const does not allow you to reassign a variable again, use the variable name in all caps as standard(it heps remembering that this variable value should not be changed)
	we cannot change the array if defined using const, but we can change items individualy like a[0]=4, etc..
	If you do not want the const value to be changes then use Object.freeze(variable name)

8. Functions changes - If we have function which is assigned to a variable then we can convert that function to arrow - 
	var magic = function() {
		return new Date();
	};
	Can be changed to
	var magic = () => {
  		return new Date();
	};
	can be changed to next if we only have one return statement
	var magic = () => new Date();
	or like below (new)
	var myConcat = (arr1, arr2) => arr1.concat(arr2);
