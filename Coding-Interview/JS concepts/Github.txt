11. git checkout -b <branch name> - this will switch to new branch and if we do git branch then it shows the new branch as green highlighted
12. git checkout master - if you need to switch from one branch to another, here we moved from new branch we created in last step to master branch
13. git merge feature1 - when you are in master branch and type this command, feature branch is merged to master branch
14. git branch -d feature1 - this will remove the branch if the changes are already merged, else will throw error
15. git branch -D feature1 - this will remove the branch even if the changes are not merged
